# Project Title
first-ml-project

This is my first project dealing with any machine learning

## Purpose of project
Getting familiar with plotting a dataset as well as to learn some machine learning algorithms and how to implement them

## Description
This project uses the iris dataset. It plots each of the four attributes separately as well as compares them using a matrix plot.
Six different mcahine learning algorithms where then used on 80% of the dataset for training and their accuracies compared.
The algorithm with the best results is then used on the final 20% for validation.
